	  <h1 class="aboutbackground">Background</h1>
	  <h3 class="aboutbgparagraph">South Korea has long had a problem with toxic workplace culture. Bad behaviour from the rich and powerful towards their employees has become so commonplace in South Korea that society coined a new word for it – ‘gapjil’. The word is a portmanteau for when people in power (gap), abuse those they employ (eul).</h3>
	  <h1 class="aboutwhy">Why it matters</h1>
	  <h3 class="aboutwhyparagraph">When one’s social status is entirely dependent on a job title or income level, those in power are enabled to treat the classes sometimes literally beneath them like servants rather than dignified employees. The problem with this is that this system is designed to not allow employees from speaking up nor protect themselves.</h3>
	  <h3 class="aboutwhyparagraph">On college campuses, students are hanging placards accusing “gapjil professors” of sexual harassment, as per The New York Times. As per CNN, Nearly 30 per cent of Korean office workers reported facing some form of workplace harassment over the past year in an online, nationwide survey of 1,000 respondents. The survey conducted by research group Embrain Public and commissioned by Workplace Gapjil 119, an organisation that assists victims of office abuse, showed respondents faced sexual harassment from superiors as well as verbal and physical abuse. One employee said they felt threatened when their supervisor swore at them angrily, while another described receiving late night text messages from her boss containing abusive and sexual language after he had been out drinking. Others faced exclusion from office groups and been insulted by superiors in front of peers.</h3>
	  <h3 class="aboutwhyparagraph"> In May, Gapjil 119 announced that its analysis of 205 reports it received from abuse victims between January 2021 and March 2022 showed that more than eight out of 10 people who reported sexual harassment at the workplace said they suffered from some form of retaliation. About 100 of the reports were from those who had filed complaints about sexual harassment to either their employer or other institutions. About 90 per cent of them said they did not receive due protection after speaking out about sexual harassment, and 83 percent said they experienced retaliation, the group said. About 64 per cent of the victims identified their supervisors as harassers, while 30 percent of the cases involved their employers, according to the group's survey, which allowed multiple responses. The study showed 79 per cent of sexual harassment victims were also bullied at the workplace.</h3>
	  <h1 class="aboutcalltoaction">Call to Action</h1>
	  <h3 class="aboutctaparagraph">In May, a revised law took effect with enhanced measures against workplace gender discrimination and sexual misconduct. Under the amendment, employees can report such incidents to the Regional Labour Relations Commission. The government agency can order corrective measures after deliberation, and employers who fail to comply without proper reasons can be fined up to 100 million won. Korea in 2019 passed a law dictating that bosses who unfairly fire workers for complaining about bullying face up to three years in prison or a 30 million won ($25,464) fine, as per CNN.</h3>
